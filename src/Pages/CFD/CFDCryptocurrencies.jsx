              Swap by interest : Since swaps are calculated and charged every
              day at the end of day time, the calculated amount of the annual
              interest rate is divided by 360. When charging swaps, first the
              cost of one symbol lot is calculated (the symbol of the opened
              position), and then the specified percent is calculated, the
              obtained amount is multiplied by the position volume (in lots) and
              the result is divided by 360. If the base currency of the symbol
              is different from the deposit currency, the swap is converted into
              the deposit currency. The conversion is performed using the
              average price at the moment of swap charging: (Bid+Ask)/2. You can
              trade CFDs on Cryptocurrencies from 00:05 to 23:55, 5 days a week
              (Monday to Friday).
